A heavily opionated React Native boilerplate. Still under construction ðŸš§ðŸ‘·
Also this readme is just a dump of notes about stuff i'll document better. Just here so i won't forget 

## Planned Features
* [flowtyped](https://flow.org/)
* [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
* latest ES features (ES2017)
* modern React syntax (no createClass, class prop autobinding)

* [Code Push](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/README.md)
* No Immutable.js (why? because it doesn't go well with flowtype :( )
* Testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
* [Airbnb JS](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (with a few tweaks)
