# Greaserocket
A heavily opionated React Native boilerplate. Still under construction ðŸš§ðŸ‘·

## Planned Features
* flowtyped
* react-navigation
* latest ES features (ES2017)
* modern React syntax (no createClass, class prop autobinding)
* Redux, Redux Loop
* Code Push
* No Immutable.js (why? because it doesn't go well with flowtype :( )
* Testing with Jest and enzyme
* Airbnb JS (with a few tweaks)
* i18n support
* Deep linking support
